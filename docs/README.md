## Challenge One: Code Refactor


### Description

 For the first weekly challenge, the task was to refactor the existing code for the website Horiseon. On the HTML side, the exising divs were renamed to appropriate and corresponding semantic elements such as 'header', 'section', and 'aside'. On the CSS side, those names were likewise changed so the style sheet would still apply the changes correctly. Likewise, the CSS was condensed where multiple classes had the same styles applied to them. Comments were also added that provide context for the specific sections in both the HTML and CSS files.
